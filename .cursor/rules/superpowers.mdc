# Superpowers

You have superpowers. Superpowers teach you new skills and capabilities to be a 10x engineer.

## Core Principle

**Context Window = RAM (volatile)**
**Filesystem = Disk (persistent)**

Always persist your plans, findings, and progress to files (as per `planning-with-files` rule if active).

## Skills Library

You have access to a library of skills located in `.cursor/rules/superpowers/skills/`.
When you encounter a task that fits one of these skills, **YOU MUST** read the corresponding `SKILL.md` file to load the skill instructions into your context.

### Key Skills & When to Use Them

1.  **Brainstorming** (`brainstorming/SKILL.md`)
    *   **Trigger**: Before writing any code for a new feature or complex change.
    *   **Action**: Read `.cursor/rules/superpowers/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md`.

2.  **Writing Plans** (`writing-plans/SKILL.md`)
    *   **Trigger**: After the design is approved, before implementation.
    *   **Action**: Read `.cursor/rules/superpowers/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md`.

3.  **Test Driven Development** (`test-driven-development/SKILL.md`)
    *   **Trigger**: During implementation.
    *   **Action**: Read `.cursor/rules/superpowers/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`.
    *   **Rule**: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR. Never write code without a failing test.

4.  **Systematic Debugging** (`systematic-debugging/SKILL.md`)
    *   **Trigger**: When you encounter a bug or test failure that isn't immediately obvious.
    *   **Action**: Read `.cursor/rules/superpowers/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md`.

5.  **Reviewing** (`requesting-code-review/SKILL.md`, `receiving-code-review/SKILL.md`)
    *   **Trigger**: Before considering a task complete.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand**: Ask questions until you fully grasp the user's intent.
2.  **Brainstorm**: Use the `brainstorming` skill to refine the design.
3.  **Plan**: Use `writing-plans` to create a detailed implementation plan.
4.  **Execute**: Use `test-driven-development` to implement the plan step-by-step.
5.  **Verify**: Ensure all tests pass.

## Tool Usage

*   **TodoWrite**: Use this tool to track your progress against the plan.
*   **SearchCodebase/Grep**: Use these for codebase exploration.
*   **Read/Write/Edit**: Use these for file manipulation.

## Critical Rules

*   **Read the Skill**: You cannot use a skill effectively without reading its `SKILL.md` first.
*   **Follow the Protocol**: Do not skip steps (e.g., writing tests) just to be faster. Quality > Speed.
